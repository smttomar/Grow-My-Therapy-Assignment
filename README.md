# Therapy Website – UI Clone & Redesign Assignment

This project is a frontend-focused assignment where a therapy website homepage was first **cloned for UI accuracy**, then **redesigned using an imaginary therapist profile**, and finally enhanced with **custom UX interactions**.  
The goal was to demonstrate attention to detail, design thinking, responsiveness, and clean implementation using modern tools.
